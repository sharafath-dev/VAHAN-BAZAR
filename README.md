# VAHAN BAZAR
## A Trusted Marketplace for Second-Hand Bikes


## Problem Statement
Buying or selling a used bike in India is challenging due to unreliable sellers, inconsistent pricing, and limited access to verified listings. This creates uncertainty for buyers and sellers, leading to poor decisions and missed opportunities.

## Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan
We aim to build **Vahan Bazar**, a user-friendly marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of pre-owned motorcycles and scooters across India. The prototype focuses on:

- A **Buy** page with advanced search and filter options to easily find bikes by brand, price range, and year.
- A **Sell** page where users can list their bikes with detailed descriptions and photos.
- A **Compare** page allowing side-by-side comparison of multiple bikesâ€™ specifications to facilitate informed decisions.
- Additional pages for dealer listings, reviews, and support (planned for future updates.
- Future updates will include financing options, expanded dealer partnerships, and additional vehicle categories.
- The design prioritizes a clean, responsive interface with verified listings for reliability.

## Features to Be Implemented
- Advanced filtering and search functionality for bike listings.
- Easy bike listing form with photo uploads and descriptions.
- Side-by-side bike comparison tool highlighting key specifications.
- Display of featured verified bikes.
- User authentication and personalized accounts (planned).
- Contact options to connect buyers with dealers.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Backend API integration for real-time data handling (planned).

## Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Routing & State Management:** React Router and React Query
- **Backend (Planned):** Node.js with Express, MongoDB
- **UI & Icons:** Custom UI components, lucide-react icons
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

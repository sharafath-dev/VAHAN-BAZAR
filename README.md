# Vahan Bazar - Your Trusted Marketplace for Second-Hand Bikes

## Problem Statement
Buying or selling a used bike in India can be challenging due to lack of verified sellers, unclear pricing, and limited access to trustworthy listings. This creates uncertainty for both buyers and sellers, leading to poor decision-making and lost opportunities.

## Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan
We aim to build **Vahan Bazar**, a user-friendly marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of pre-owned motorcycles and scooters across India. The prototype focuses on:

- A **Buy** page with advanced search and filter options to easily find bikes by brand, price range, and year.
- A **Sell** page where users can list their bikes with detailed descriptions and photos.
- A **Compare** page allowing side-by-side comparison of multiple bikesâ€™ specifications to facilitate informed decisions.
- Additional pages for dealer listings, reviews, and support to build trust among users.

The design prioritizes a clean, responsive interface with verified listings for reliability.

## Features to Be Implemented
- Advanced filtering and search functionality for bike listings.
- Easy bike listing form with photo uploads and descriptions.
- Side-by-side bike comparison tool highlighting key specifications.
- Display of featured verified bikes.
- User authentication and personalized accounts (planned).
- Contact options to connect buyers with dealers.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Backend API integration for real-time data handling.

## Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Routing & State Management:** React Router and React Query
- **Backend (Planned):** Node.js with Express, MongoDB database
- **UI & Icons:** Custom UI components, lucide-react icons
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
